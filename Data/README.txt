The other_data_locations.txt file provides information about whether other data files are hosted.

These data files should be downloaded into this data directory. The R scripts will look for them there. 

We have also provided the download_data.sh file. If you run this, (e.g. cd into the data/ folder from the terminal, then type "./download_data.sh") then it will automatically download all the data for you.
