scc_lung_addchr1.csv - This dataset holds the TWAS results for the mediation analysis. The first two columns are the gene transcript and HGNC gene name. The third column is the Z score for testing the association of the gene with lung cancer. The last column is the p-value associated with the Z score.

bmi_with_overall.txt - This dataset holds summary statistics for three and two-way pleiotropy analysis. The first column is the location of the SNP in chromosome:position notation for Grch37 build. The second column is the row number of the dataset. The third column is the RS identifier of the SNP. The fourth column is the p-value for association between the SNP and squamous cell lung cancer in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) dataset. The fifth column is the p-value for association between the SNP and coronary artery disease (CAD) in the cardiogramplusc4d datset. The sixth column is the Z statistic for association with squamous cell lung cancer in ILCCO. The seventh column is the Z statistic for association with CAD in the cardiogramplusc4d dataset. The eighth column is the p-value for association with CAD in the UK Biobank dataset. The ninth column is the Z statistic for association with CAD in the UK Biobank. The ninth column is the p-value for association with lung cancer overall in the UK Biobank. The tenth column is the test statistic for association with lung cancer overall in the UK Biobank. The eleventh column is the p-value for association with body mass index (BMI) in the GIANT consortium cohort. The twelfth column is Z statistic for association with BMI in GIANT. The thirteenth and fourteenth columns the Z statistic and p-value for association with lung cancer overall in the ILCCO dataset.

replication_with_lcoverall.txt - This dataset holds summary statistics for the lung cancer replication analysis. The first column is the location of the SNP in chromosome:position notation for Grch37 build. The second and third are the effect and reference alleles in ILCCO for squamous cell lung cancer. The fourth is the effect allele frequency in ILCCO. The fifth is the p-value for association with squamous cell lung cancer in ILCCO, and the sixth is the asociated Z statistic. The seventh are the effect and reference alleles in the UK Biobank. The eighth is the p-value for lung cancer overall in the UK Biobank, and the ninth is the associated Z statistic. The tenth and eleventh columns are binary indicators of whether the effect alleles are the same in both datasets. The twelfth and thirteenth columns are the effect and reference alleles for lung cancer overall in ILCCO. The fourteenth is the associated effect alelle frequency. The fifteenth and sixteenth columns are Z statistics and p-values for lung cancer overall in ILCCO. The last two columns are binary indicators for whether the effect alleles are the same in both datasets.

cad_for_replication - This dataset holds summary statistics for CAD replication analysis. The first column is the location of the SNP in chromosome:position notation for Grch37 build. The second and third are effect and reference alleles in cardiogramplusc4d dataset. The fourth is effect allele frequency in cardiogramplusc4d dataset. The fifth and sixth are p-value and Z statistic for association with CAD in cardiogramplusc4d dataset. The seventh are effect and reference allele in UK Biobank. The eighth and ninth are p-value and Z statistic for association with CAD in UK Biobank. The tenth and eleventh column are binary indicators for whether the effect alleles are the same in both datasets.
