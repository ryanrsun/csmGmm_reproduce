The Three Outcome Summary Statistics are harmonized and cleaned summary statistics used to perform the three-way and two-way pleiotropy analyses in the manuscript. They contain summary statistics for lung cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and BMI. Please see manuscript for more details.

The CAD Only Summary Statistics hold only summary statistics for coronary artery disease from the UK Biobank and the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. They are used for replication analysis of CAD risk SNPs.
